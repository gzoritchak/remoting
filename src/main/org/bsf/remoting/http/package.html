Allows a client to communicate with the server using http calls.
<p>
The client asks for a service using the HttpServiceFactory. He gets a reference
on a service which is in reality a dynamic proxy (@see java.lang.reflect.Proxy).
This Proxy dispatches all the method invocation to the Service which implements
the InvocationHandler interface. The Service then delegates the invocation to the
HttpSessionClient singleton. This class is responsible for the communication with
the server. It encapsulates the method invocation in http request using
HttpServiceRequest instances. On theserver, the servlet HttpSessionServer gets
the HttpServiceRequest and performs the invocation on the EJB reference
corresponding to the service.
