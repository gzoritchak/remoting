This is done with the use of Dynamic Proxies. They allow a class to			implements interfaces specified at runtime when the class is created. This			feature is perfect for our goal because all the remote invocations on EJBs			are based on interfaces.			<p />			The client sees its remote interface but in reality it is an instance of			HttpServiceInvocationHandler that receives the method calls. This class			then delegates the calls to the HttpSessionClient.			<p />			<h4>Configuration</h4>			<p />			The client sets the config parameters of the client session			by calling few method on the HttpServiceFactory :<pre>    HttpServiceFactory factory = new HttpServiceFactory();    factory.setPort(8080);    factory.setContext("myApp");    factory.setHost("localhost");</pre>			<p />			These parameters are then used by the HttpSessionClient to process the HTTP			requests			<h4>Interaction diagram</h4>            <img src="remoting-client-side.png" alt="Client side architecture" />			<p />			To retrieve a reference on a EJB interface, the client asks it to the			HttpServiceFactory :<pre>    MyService myService = factory.getService(new EJBDefinition(                            "ejb/myJndiName", "test.MyServiceHome",                            "test.MyService"));</pre>			<p />			The constructor of the EJBDefinition takes the jndi name, the home class name and			the remote class name as parameters. They are used on the server side to perform			the lookup and the narrowing.			<p />            The HttpServiceFactory use the remote class to create a dynamic proxy implementing            it. The client sees a remote interface of an EJB. When the client make a call on            this interface, the method and the parameters of the call are transmitted to the            HttpServiceInvocationHandler which delegates the call to the HttpSessionClient.			<p />			This class is responsible for the HTTP stuff. It maintains the session with the			server using url rewriting. It serializes the call as an Object Stream into the			http stream and handle the response. When the response is another EJB (for instance			a reference on statefull EJB) the object sent back by the server is an instance of			HttpServiceKey. The HttpSessionClient then creates a new dynamic proxy for the client			that implements the new EJB. In case of a serialized object or exception			the client receives it normally.			<p />			<h3>On the server</h3>            <img src="remoting-server-side.png" alt="Server side architecture" />			<p />			The HttpSessionServer servlet is responsible for handling the client calls.			<p />			It creates a session at first call. The session id is return to the client using			the jsessionid HTTP header.			<p />			The HttpSessionServer uses the EJBDefinition to lookup the EJBHome on the InitialContext			and create an EJB. It always uses a create method without argument.			<p />			Then it invocates the call using reflection. The result is sent back to the client using			the HttpOutputStream. If the result is another session EJB (stateful or stateless) the			reference on that EJB is kept in the user session and a HttpServiceKey is returned back			to the client. The HttpClientSession handles that key to creates the awaiting interface.			<p />			<p />		</div>		<div id="menu">            <ul>                <li><a href="overview.html">Overview</a></li>                <li><a href="architecture.html">Architecture</a></li>                <li><a href="authentication.html">Authentication</a></li>                <li><a href="deployment.html">Packaging</a></li>                <li><a href="using.html">How to use it?</a></li>                <li><a href="javadoc/index.html" target="_blank">Javadoc</a></li>            </ul>		</div>	</body></html>
